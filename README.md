# [Sap](http://suikacraft.com)

Sap is a Minecraft mod focused entirely on adding new realistic tree species.

This mod was created for the *[SuikaCraft](https://github.com/yurisuika/SuikaCraft)* datapack for *[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged)*. While saplings can be attained from trades, the added species are not made to be generated without the TerraForged datapack.

This is the first of an eventual series of mods that seek to add realistic species to the game. Sap is all about trees. Other upcoming mods will add in new flora and other species.
