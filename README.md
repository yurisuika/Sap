# [Sap](http://suikacraft.com)

Sap is a Forge mod for Minecraft that brings a diverse array of tree species to your worlds!

This mod was created for the *[SuikaCraft](https://github.com/yurisuika/SuikaCraft)* datapack for *[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged)*. While saplings can be attained from trades, the added species are not made to be generated without the TerraForged datapack.

Sap is a mod that seeks to add realistic species to the game. Currently, Sap is all about trees. However, in time we will add in more flora! Fauna and sediments are on the planning board too for future mods!

While currently only available in the style of *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)*, one day we will support vanilla textures. Be sure to enable Custom Colors in Optifine to take advantage of the colormaps!
