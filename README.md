# <p align="center">SAP</p>

Sap is a Forge mod for Minecraft that brings a diverse array of tree species to your worlds!

This mod was created for the *[SuikaCraft](https://github.com/yurisuika/SuikaCraft)* data pack for *[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged)*. While saplings can be attained from trades, the added species are not made to be generated without the TerraForged data pack.

Sap is a mod that seeks to add realistic species to the game. Currently, Sap is all about trees. However, in time we will add in more flora! Fauna and sediments are on the planning board too for future mods!

While currently only available in the style of *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)*, one day we will support vanilla textures. Check out the custom model packs while you're at it! Be sure to enable Custom Colors in Optifine to take advantage of the colormaps!

While Optifine does not current support loading assets from other mods, you can either extract the shader data from the jar and put it in your pack to make Sap's blocks rustle in the wind or use the custom model pack to add them to your list. Be sure to toggle shaders to enable Optifine detects Sap's blocks, otherwise it will have loaded the shaders before detecting Sap's blocks!
